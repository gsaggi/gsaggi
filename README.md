- 👋 Hi, I’m @gsaggi
- 👀 I’m interested in programming & cats 😺
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# & React
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects promoting animal & social welfare
- ⚡ Fun fact: Cheetah's are the biggest small cat & they are anxious animals, so much so that when in captivity they are raised with a support dog so they feel secure
